The tool is an integral part of [Cloud View](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/19893178414226-AWS-Cloud-View-BETA), an app in Miro that allows you to visualize and optimize your cloud infrastructure. Ideal for cloud practitioners, CloudView leverages Miro's powerful visualization capabilities to help you gain insights and improve your cloud management strategies.
